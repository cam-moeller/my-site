This site serves as my portfolio and blog. It's built with Next.js 16 using the App Router, TypeScript in strict mode, and Tailwind CSS v4. Content is authored in MDX and rendered server-side via `next-mdx-remote`.

Features include a dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence, statically generated blog posts and project pages, and a clean, minimal design focused on readability.
